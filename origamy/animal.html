camel:A camel is an even-toed ungulate in the genus Camelus that bears distinctive
 fatty deposits known as "humps" on its back. Camels have long been domesticated and, 
as livestock, they provide food (milk and meat) and textiles (fiber and felt from hair).
Camels are working animals especially suited to their desert habitat and are a vital means of transport
for passengers and cargo. There are three surviving species of camel. The one-humped dromedary
makes up 94% of the world's camel population, and the two-humped Bactrian camel makes up 6%.
The Wild Bactrian camel is a separate species and is now critically endangered.
The word camel is also used informally in a wider sense, where the more correct term is "camelid",
to include all seven species of the family Camelidae: the true camels (the above three species),
along with the "New World" camelids: the llama, the alpaca, the guanaco, and the vicuña.
[7] The word itself is derived via Latin: camelus and Greek: κάμηλος (kamēlos) from Hebrew,
 Arabic or Phoenician: gāmāl.


chemeleon:Chameleons are reptiles that are part of the iguana suborder.
 These colorful lizards are known as one of the
 few animals that can change skin color. However,
  it is a misconception that chameleons change colors to match their surroundings.
Size
According to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS), there are 171 species of chameleons.
 With so many different species, there are many different sizes. 
The largest chameleon is the Parson’s chameleon, according to Encyclopedia Britannica.
 It can grow up to 27 inches (69.5 centimeters) long. The Madagascan, also known as the Oustalet's chameleon,
  is also very large and grows up to 23 inches (60 cm) long.
The smallest chameleon has a special distinction. It is also one of the smallest vertebrates ever discovered.
 The leaf chameleon grows to just 0.5 inches (16 millimeters) and can sit comfortably on the head of a match.


cicada:The cicadas (/sɪˈkɑːdə/ or /sɪˈkeɪdə/) are a superfamily, the Cicadoidea, of insects in the order
 Hemiptera (true bugs). They are in the suborder Auchenorrhyncha,[a] along with smaller jumping bugs
  such as leafhoppers and froghoppers. The superfamily is divided into two families, Tettigarctidae,
with two species in Australia, and Cicadidae, with more than 3,000 species described from around the world;
 many species remain undescribed.
Cicadas have prominent eyes set wide apart, short antennae, and membranous front wings.
 They have an exceptionally loud song, produced in most species by the rapid buckling and unbuckling of
drumlike tymbals. The earliest known fossil Cicadomorpha appeared in the Upper Permian period;
extant species occur all around the world in temperate to tropical climates. They typically live in trees,
 feeding on watery sap from xylem tissue and laying their eggs in a slit in the bark. Most cicadas are cryptic.
 The vast majority of species are active during the day as adults, with some calling at dawn or dusk.
 Only a rare few species are known to be nocturnal.
One genus, the periodical cicadas spend most of their lives as underground nymphs,
 emerging only after 13 or 17 years. The unusual duration and timing of their emergence may reduce the number
  of cicadas lost to predation, both by making them a less reliably available prey
 (so that any predator who evolved to depend on cicadas for sustenance might starve waiting for
  their emergence), and by emerging in such huge numbers that they will satiate any remaining predators before
sing enough of their number to threaten their survival as a species.
The annual cicadas are species that emerge every year.
 Though these cicadas have lifecycles that can vary from one to nine or more years as underground larvae,
 their emergence above ground as adults is not synchronized, so some members of each species appear every year.
 [1]
Cicadas have been featured in literature since the time of Homer's Iliad,
 and as motifs in art from the Chinese Shang dynasty. They have also been used in myth and folklore
  as symbols of carefree living and immortality. The cicada is also mentioned in Hesiod's Shield (ll.393–394),
   its voice sings when millet first ripens. Cicadas are eaten by humans in various countries, including
 China, where the nymphs are served deep-fried in Shandong cuisine.
